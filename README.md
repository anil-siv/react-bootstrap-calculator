# react-bootstrap-calculator
FreeCodeCamp Front End project to build a calculator using a front end framework that handled negative numbers and minimal user errors with operators.

This exercise taught me a lot about state mutability, helper functions when accessing prevState to change currentState.

Uses the math.js library for safe evaluation of expressions.
